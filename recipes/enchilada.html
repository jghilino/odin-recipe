        <h2>Easier and More Delicious than Fast Food Mexican!</h2>
            <p>Very easy to make! Chicken and Monterey Jack Cheese filled flour tortillas topped with green enchilada sauce. I make Mexican Rice to serve on the side.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>12 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                <li>1 (19 ounce) can green enchilada sauce</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a pot with enough water to cover, boil the chicken 25 minutes, or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.</li>
                <li>Fill each tortilla with equal amounts of chicken and cheese, reserving 1/4 cup cheese for topping. Roll tortillas to form enchiladas. Arrange enchiladas in the prepared baking dish. Cover with the enchilada sauce.</li>
                <li>Bake enchiladas 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Top with reserved cheese, and continue baking 5 minutes, until cheese is melted.</li>
            </ol>
